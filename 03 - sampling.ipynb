    "In this activity, you will engage in effective sampling of a dataset in order to make it easier to analyze. As a data professional you will often work with extremely large datasets, and utilizing proper sampling techniques helps you improve your efficiency in this work. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this activity, you are a member of an analytics team for the Environmental Protection Agency. You are assigned to analyze data on air quality with respect to carbon monoxide—a major air pollutant—and report your findings. The data utilized in this activity includes information from over 200 sites, identified by their state name, county name, city name, and local site name. You will use effective sampling within this dataset. "
